# tos-keybinds
A small application to customize key bindings in Tree of Savior.

# Requirements
Requires Java 7 to run.


# Usage
Upon starting you will be prompted to select your hotkey.xml file. These are located in your game folder 
(For example: "C:\Program Files\Stream\SteamApps\common\TreeOfSavior\release\hotkey.xml")
There is also the corresponding file for mousemode (hotkey_mousemode.xml) in the same folder.

Once you select and open it, you can change keys by clicking on the corresponding button.

Make sure to hit save in the menubar to save your result!


# Common problems ::

Currently a number of keys don't map properly. The number keys (0-9) don't seem to register correctly. Likewise,
special characters may cause problems.

The program has not been extensively tested, if you find any issues please file them at [[GITHUB ISSUES SECTION]]
